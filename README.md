TRX
===

A pair of arduino nanos talking wirelessly using the virtualwire library and some cheap chinese TX / RX modules.

The basestation (TX) can choose which of 8 groups to activate (which will deactivate the rest)
The RX modules can choose which goup the belong to, and activate acordingly


OH.. this is also my first project using the ino tool. (and plugin for sublime text 3)
