TRX
===

Arduino nanos talking wirelessly using the virtualwire library and some cheap chinese TX / RX modules.

The basestation (TX) can choose which of 8 groups to activate (which will deactivate the rest)

The RX modules can choose which goup the belong to, and activate acordingly.

I'm trying to use cleverness to achieve what I need using only one-way communications.


OH.. this is also my first project using the ino tool. (and plugin for sublime text 3)
